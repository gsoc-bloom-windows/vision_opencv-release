Description: `image_geometry` contains C++ and Python libraries for interpreting images geometrically.
 It interfaces the calibration parameters in sensor_msgs/CameraInfo messages with OpenCV functions such as image rectification, much as cv_bridge interfaces ROS sensor_msgs/Image with OpenCV data types.
